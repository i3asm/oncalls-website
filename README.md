# on-calls scheduler

## WHY
I made this website to help me make the perfect on-calls schedule for a hospital.

when a doctor is assigned to an on-call that means he will stay in the hospital for 24 hours and that is really exhausting, the doctor will stay for 16 hours after his 8 hours job to check on patients and make sure they are ok and stable for the rest of the day.

## REQUIREMENTS
The project requirements are quite complecated, this is just an idea if it:
1. There is an X number of doctors. they should cover Y number of days. each day have Z number of sections to cover by a single doctor.
2. at least two days off between the on-call day.
3. Every on-call have a points depending on how hard is it. keep record of the previous points of each doctor.
4. Fridays and Saturdays counted as two points, the rest is one point.
5. the schedule should be fair. every doctor takes the same amount of weekends and weekdays on-calls and the same points.

there is a lot more to do, I got busy and didn't complete the project and made the schedule manually on excel.
anyway, I would love to see your contributions here. I can use some algorithms to make sure the schedule is fair for everyone.
soon I willcomplete this project, especially that I took an AI course in college and I know this should be easy with a simple backtracking algorithm (actually this didn't work).
